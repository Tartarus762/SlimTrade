## Incomplete Features & Known Issues
- When using game detection, bounds are not saved, but detection is rerun at launch (and manually from options)
- Changing client.txt file requires a restart
- Currency icons & translations only use POE1 data
- Theme & UI improvements incomplete

## Path of Exile 2
- SlimTrade now works seamlessly with Path of Exile 1 & 2
- Added currency icons & currency translations for POE 2 (updated for POE1)

## Game Window
- Added a new windowId detection system for UI alignment, replacing the old stash alignment windowId
- Unpinned windows are centered in the game windowId, rather than your first monitor

## Cloud Gaming
- Added partial support for GeForce Now (other platforms upon request)
- Features that require access to game files DO NOT work (trade popups, chat scanner, history)
- All other features should work (game macros, cheat sheets, stash/npc searching)
- Things might be buggy

## Additional Changes
- Many small UI improvements
- Adjusted the way windows are displayed on top of the game window
- Fixed a crash on systems that don't support a system tray
- Fixed preferred font changed the first time you saved after installing
- Possible improvements for Mac & Linux (untested)
