## Folder Offset Option
- The offset of the stash helper can now be increased to account for folders. *Options > General > Basics > Folder Offset*
- Don't forget that SlimTrade's item highlighter can be disabled, and instead you can left click the stash helper to search for items using POE's inbuilt highlighting.

## Bug Fixes
- Chat scanner buttons can now be correctly reordered using the arrow buttons.
- Fixed a bug where various parts of the UI could be clicked to move the windowId instead of just the title bar.
