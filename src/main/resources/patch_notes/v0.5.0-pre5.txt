**This version is not well tested.** Prereleases must be installed manually once, but still receive automated updates.

## Known Issues
- Save file is not backwards compatible and will corrupt if you downgrade. Backup "SlimTrade" folder if you care (Options > Information > Settings Folder)
- When using game detection, bounds are not saved. Detection is rerun at launch (and can be triggered from options)
- Changing client.txt file requires a restart
- Currency icons & translations only use POE1 data
- Theme & UI improvements incomplete
- "Zone" text replacement doesn't work

## pre5
- TODO

## Path of Exile 2
- SlimTrade now works seamlessly with Path of Exile 1 & 2
- Added currency icons & translations for POE 2 (updated for POE1)
- **POE2 broke Incoming/Outgoing whisper detection. POE2 outgoing trades require an extra hotkey until fixed by GGG**

## Game Window
- Added a new window detection system for UI alignment, replacing the old stash alignment window
- Unpinned windows are now centered relative to the game window on launch

## Additional Changes
- Many small UI improvements
- Adjusted the way windows are displayed on top of the game window
- Fixed a crash on systems that don't support a system tray
- Fixed preferred font changed the first time you saved after installing
- Possible improvements for Mac & Linux (untested)

## Cloud Gaming
- Added partial support for GeForce Now (other platforms upon request)
- Features that require access to game files DO NOT work (trade popups, chat scanner, history)
- All other features should work (game macros, cheat sheets, stash/npc searching)
- Things might be buggy

## How to Install
- Make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com) installed
