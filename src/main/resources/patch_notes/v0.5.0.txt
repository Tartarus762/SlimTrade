# Path of Exile 2
- SlimTrade now works seamlessly with both POE 1 & 2
- Added currency icons & translations for POE 2 (updated for POE1)
- A new window detection system for UI alignment
- **Be sure to report any alignment issues with the new system!**

## Cloud Gaming
- Added partial support for GeForce Now (other platforms upon request)
- Features that require access to game files DO NOT work (trade popups, chat scanner, history)
- All other features should work (game macros, cheat sheets, stash/npc searching)
- Things might be buggy

## Improvements
- Many small UI improvements
- Fixed a crash on systems that don't support a system tray

## How to Install
